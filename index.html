    <h1 >Doughnut</h1>  
    <p > A doughnut is a type of food made from leavened fried dough.
      It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack
      that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarket, food stall, and franchised
       specialty vendors. Doughnut is the traditional spelling, while donut s the simplified
       version; the term are used interchangedably.

        <p>The cookbook Küchenmeisterei (Mastery of the Kitchen), published in Nuremberg in 1485, 
          offers a recipe for "Gefüllte Krapfen", sugar free, stuffed, fried dough cakes.

        Dutch settlers brought olykoek ("oil(y) cake") to New York (or New Amsterdam) in the early 
          18th century. These doughnuts closely resembled later ones but did not yet have their current
           ring shape.
          A recipe for fried dough "nuts" was published, in 1750 England, under the title "How to make 
          Hertfordshire Cakes, Nuts and Pincushions”, in The Country Housewife's Family Companion by 
          William Ellis.
          A recipe labelled "dow nuts", again from Hertfordshire, was found in a book of recipes and
           domestic tips written ar Baroness by an acquaintance who transcribed for her the
             cooking instructions for a "dow nut".
          The first cookbook using the near conventional "dough nuts" spelling was possibly the
           1803 edition of "The Frugal Housewife: Or, Complete Woman Cook", which included doughnuts 
           in an appendix of American recipes.
          One of the earliest mentions of "dough-nut" was in Washington Irving's 1809 book A History
           of New York, from the Beginning of the World to the End of the the dutch Dynas </p>

        <h3>Types of doughnut</h3>
        <p >There are diffrent types of doughnut with diffrent recipes but the two common
          types of doughnut are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut which is injected
          with fruit preserves cream, custard or other sweet fillings. The ring doughnut are 
          once fried,may be glazed with a sugar icing,spread with chocolate or topped with 
          powdered sugar, cinnamom, sprinkles of fruit. Other type shapes include balls, 
          flattened spheres, twists, and other forms.

        <h4>Etymology of doughnut</h4>
        <p>"Dough nut"</br>
          One of the earliest known literary usages of the term dates to an 1808 short story
           describing a spread of "fire-cakes and dough-nuts". Washington Irving described "dough-nuts", 
           in his 1809 History of New York, as "balls of sweetened dough, fried in hog's fat, and called 
           dough-nuts, or olykoeks." These "nuts" of fried dough might now be called doughnut holes. The word
            nut is here used in the earlier sense of "small rounded cake or cookie", also seen in 
            ginger nut.Doughnut is the traditional spelling and still dominates even in the United State
             though donut is often used.At present, doughnut and the shortened form donut are both pervasive
              in American English. <br>
              "Donut" </br>
              The first known printed use of donut was in Peck's Bad Boy and his Pa by George W. 
              Peck, published in 1900, in which a character is quoted as saying, "Pa said he guessed
               he hadn't got much appetite, and he would just drink a cup of coffee and eat a donut.
                According to author John T. Edge the alternative spelling "donut" was invented in the 1920s
                 when the New York-based Display Doughnut Machine Corporation abbreviated the word to make
                  it more pronounceable by the foreigners they hoped would buy their automated doughnut 
                  making equipment. The donut spelling also showed up in a Los Angeles Times
                   article dated August 10, 1929 in which Bailey Millard jokingly complains about 
                   the decline of spelling, and that he "can't swallow the 'wel-dun donut' nor the 
                   ever so 'gud bred'."
              
              The interchangeability of the two spellings can be found in a series of 
              "National Donut Week" articles in The New York Times that covered the 1939 World's Fair.
               In four articles beginning October 9, two mention the donut spelling. Dunkin' Donuts,
                which was so-named in 1950, following its 1948 founding under the name Open Kettle
                 (Quincy, Massachusetts), is the oldest surviving company to use the donut variation; 
                 other chains, such as the defunct Mayflower Doughnut Corporation (1931), did not use that 
                 spelling. According to the Oxford Dictionaries while "doughnut" is used internationally,
                  the spelling "donut" is American. The spelling "donut" remained rare until the 1950s,
                   and has since grown significantly in popularity;this growth in use has possibly been 
                   influenced by the spread of Dunkin' Donuts.
